       InterContinental Dhaka is a prominent luxury hotel in Ramna in central Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. 

        It was the first international five-star hotel in the country. Since its inception in 1962, the five-star 
        hotel has been known by many names such as “InterContinental Dhaka,” “Hotel Sheraton” and “Ruposhi Bangla”
         over the years till 2013

        The hotel played host to many important political events in the run-up to the independence of Bangladesh,
         including negotiations on the transfer of power after the 1970 elections. During the Bangladesh Liberation War
          in 1971, it was declared a neutral zone by the International Red Cross. Many buildings in its surrounding
           neighborhoods were targeted by the Pakistani military, including newspaper offices and university halls.
        
        InterContinental Hotels continued to operate the hotel until 1983, when it was taken over by Sheraton,
         becoming the Sheraton Dhaka Hotel. In 2011, Sheraton announced that it would end its contract with the 
         Bangladeshi government to manage the hotel, which was renamed the Ruposhi Bangla Hotel. In 2013, it was announced that ICHG would return to Dhaka. The hotel was given a major renovation and reopened as the InterContinental Dhaka in December 2018.[6] The vicinity of the hotel includes the Shahbag roundabout, the Suhrawardy Udyan, Ramna Park, the Dhaka Club, the University of Dhaka, 
        BSMMU, BIRDEM Hospital, the Bangladesh National Museum, and official state guest houses.</P>
